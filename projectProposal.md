For my project topic I found data on animal adoptions in Austin, TX. The data I will be using exists in two separate data files on https://data.austintexas.gov/. These tables report animal shelters intake of animals and animal outcomes. These can be found at https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm and https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238. 

My plan for this project is to clean and join the two data tables to create a unified dataset and then to explore a few questions such as the adoption rates of animals at different times of the year, what factors are correlated to what outcomes and how often different animals are found or adopted.

I may also look into creating using R to query their API and applying machine learning to the dataset.
